        <!-- This Jackson-related issue seems to be related to module jackson-dataformat-xml, which is not used here.
        It is considered a false positive.
        See https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/517
        In addition it was fixed in version 1.7.4., see https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml/issues/199
